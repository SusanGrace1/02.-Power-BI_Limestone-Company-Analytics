* Demonstrate proficiency in Power BI.
* Create a professional portfolio piece.

**Analysis and Visualization:**

* Analyze and visualize sales, production, and operational cost data.
* Showcase data storytelling through interactive dashboards.
* Identify key trends and patterns.
* Analyze profitability, sales performance, production efficiency, and operational costs.

**Documentation:**

* Document the data generation process using Python, Pandas, and Faker.

### Data Source

The data used in this Power BI project is AI-generated, simulating two years of operational data for a fictional limestone company in Kenya. To create a realistic dataset, Python was employed using the Pandas library for data manipulation and the Faker library for generating synthetic data. The dataset encompasses four key areas of the company's operations:

* **Production:** Detailing daily limestone extraction across three quarries, including tonnage produced and production costs.
* **Sales:** Recording individual sales transactions, customer details, limestone types sold, and regional sales distribution.
* **Customers:** Providing demographic information for 50 unique customers, including their industry, location, and county.
* **Operational Costs:** Outlining expenses incurred across various categories such as fuel, maintenance, labor, and transportation.

This approach allowed for the creation of a comprehensive dataset, facilitating the analysis of sales trends, production efficiency, and cost management within the Power BI environment.
