# Kenyan Limestone Company: Power BI Data Analysis

### Table of Contents

### Project Overview

A Power BI project focused on analyzing and visualizing operational data for a simulated limestone company in Kenya. The project includes interactive dashboards that explore production trends, sales performance, customer segmentation, and cost analysis.The dashboards aim to provide actionable insights into the company's performance and identify areas for improvement. This repository serves as a portfolio piece showcasing data analysis and business intelligence capabilities.

### Project Goals
**Core Objectives:**

* Demonstrate proficiency in Power BI.
* Create a professional portfolio piece.

**Analysis and Visualization:**

* Analyze and visualize sales, production, and operational cost data.
* Showcase data storytelling through interactive dashboards.
* Identify key trends and patterns.
* Analyze profitability, sales performance, production efficiency, and operational costs.

**Documentation:**

* Document the data generation process using Python, Pandas, and Faker.

### Data Source

The data used in this Power BI project is AI-generated, simulating two years of operational data for a fictional limestone company in Kenya. To create a realistic dataset, Python was employed using the Pandas library for data manipulation and the Faker library for generating synthetic data. The dataset encompasses four key areas of the company's operations:

* **Production:** Detailing daily limestone extraction across three quarries, including tonnage produced and production costs.
* **Sales:** Recording individual sales transactions, customer details, limestone types sold, and regional sales distribution.
* **Customers:** Providing demographic information for 50 unique customers, including their industry, location, and county.
* **Operational Costs:** Outlining expenses incurred across various categories such as fuel, maintenance, labor, and transportation.

This approach allowed for the creation of a comprehensive dataset, facilitating the analysis of sales trends, production efficiency, and cost management within the Power BI environment.

**Key Insights**

This page provides a deeper dive into the profitability of the limestone company, segmented by key factors.

**Profit by Limestone Type:** Agricultural limestone is the most profitable type, significantly outperforming High-Calcium and Dolomitic varieties. This suggests a strong market demand or higher margins for agricultural products.

**Profit by Customer Type:** Construction customers generate the highest profit, followed by Agriculture and then Industrial. This highlights the importance of the construction sector to the company's profitability.

**Profit per Ton Trend:** The Profit per Ton fluctuates throughout the year for both 2023 and 2024. However, 2024 generally shows a higher Profit per Ton, particularly in the later months, indicating improved profitability per unit sold year-over-year.

**Profit by Region (2024):** The Coast region is the dominant contributor to profit, followed by Central and Nairobi. Eastern and Rift Valley regions contribute the least. This highlights significant regional disparities in profitability.

**Overall Analysis:**

The profitability analysis indicates that the company's profitability has improved in 2024 compared to 2023, as seen in the "Profit per Ton" trend. Agricultural limestone and Construction customers are key drivers of profit. There are significant regional differences in profitability, with the Coast region being the most lucrative. Further investigation could explore the reasons behind the success of agricultural limestone and the Coast region, as well as strategies to improve profitability in other areas and understand the seasonal fluctuations in profit per ton.

### 3. Sales Performance Page

**Key Insights**
This page provides a comprehensive overview of the company's sales performance, broken down by key dimensions.

**Sales Trend Over Time:** While both 2023 and 2024 show fluctuations, 2024 generally exhibits higher sales revenue, particularly in the latter half of the year. This indicates positive sales growth year-over-year.

**Regional Sales (2024):** The Western region is the top sales generator, followed closely by Central and Coast. Rift Valley shows the lowest sales volume, highlighting significant regional disparities in market penetration or demand.

**Top 5 Customers:** Kilimanjaro Logistics is the leading customer by a significant margin, followed by Uhuru Mining and Pwani Builders. This emphasizes the importance of these key accounts to the company's revenue stream.

**Sales by Limestone Type:** Agricultural limestone accounts for the largest share of sales revenue (36.54%), closely followed by Dolomitic (36.12%). High-Calcium contributes a smaller portion (27.34%). This indicates the varying market demand for different limestone products.

**Overall Analysis:**

The Sales Performance page reveals a positive sales trajectory for the company, with 2024 outperforming 2023. However, sales are heavily concentrated in specific regions and among a few key customers. Agricultural and Dolomitic limestone are the primary drivers of sales revenue. Further analysis could explore strategies to increase sales in underperforming regions, diversify the customer base, and understand the factors driving the success of the top-selling limestone types. The consistent growth in the latter part of 2024 suggests successful strategies or market factors during that period.
